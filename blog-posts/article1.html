    <h2>If the GDP is growing, why are we miserable?</h2>
    <p>At a glance, the world looks like it’s thriving. Stock markets hit record highs, GDP figures soar, and innovation races ahead. Yet beneath the surface of this boom, a paradox persists: despite the numbers, people aren’t feeling better. In fact, they’re often feeling worse.</p>

    <p>In school, we’re taught that economic growth is supposed to be a good thing. More jobs, more income, more development. But in real life, it often feels like this growth only benefits a few people at the top, while the rest of us are stuck hustling harder just to keep up. This is exactly what Nobel Prize-winning economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller talk about in their book <em>Phishing for Phools</em>. They say that instead of giving people what they need, markets often trick us into wanting things we don’t. It’s like that feeling when you're convinced you need the latest iPhone even though your old one works fine—it’s not really about the phone, it’s about how ads and influencers make us feel like we’re missing out.</p>

    <p>According to Akerlof and Shiller, we live in a “phishing equilibrium,” where companies succeed by manipulating our emotions—selling us junk food we know is bad, pushing us into debt with “limited time” offers, and making us feel like we’ll never be enough unless we buy more, do more, be more. And that’s exhausting.</p>

    <p>GDP doesn’t show how people actually feel. It doesn’t count stress, anxiety, loneliness, or burnout. It doesn’t reflect how people are working 10-hour shifts just to pay bills or how social media constantly makes you feel like you're falling behind. It’s like judging someone’s health just by looking at their weight—it misses everything that matters inside.</p>

    <p>So what can actually help? A lot of people say things like "change the system" or "just shop less," but that’s not super realistic when you're living in it every day. A more practical step might be to start including mental and social wellbeing in how we measure progress. Some countries, like New Zealand, have actually started using a “wellbeing budget” that tracks things like mental health, community connection, and sustainability—not just money. On a smaller level, schools and workplaces can bring in real-life financial literacy classes and mental health support, not just random lectures. Even teaching people how ads work or how debt traps are designed could make a huge dif
