    <h1>Why Printing More Money Doesn't Work</h1>

      <p>Let’s take the case of Germany 1923. The country was already suffering from high levels of inflation due to the effects of the war and increasing government debt. In order to pay the striking workers, the government simply printed more money. This flood of money led to hyperinflation: the more money was printed, the more prices rose. People were seen carrying bags of money just to buy a loaf of bread.</p>

      <p>To understand why printing more money doesn’t solve economic problems, we need to first understand the basic concept of supply and demand.</p>

      <p>Let’s say I have only one Clinique Black Honey lipstick, and every single one of you wants it. I’m obviously going to give it to the highest bidder, and it’s certainly not going for ₹500. But now imagine I have a million of those same lipsticks. I can’t charge top dollar anymore—because everyone can easily find one. When something is limited in supply, its value increases. The more common something becomes, the less it is worth. This inverse relationship is the key to understanding inflation.</p>

      <p>So what happens when governments print more money? Every time they do, they increase the money supply. And when the supply of money increases without an increase in goods and services, the value of that money drops. That’s inflation.</p>

      <p>For example, let’s say one rupee buys you a candy bar today. But if we keep printing money to “fix” our problems, the supply of money grows, its value falls—and now that same rupee may only buy you half a candy bar. Over time, your money simply doesn’t buy the same things it used to.</p>

      <p>In short, printing more money might seem like an easy fix, but it’s a trap. It devalues the currency, raises prices, and ultimately makes everyone poorer.</p>
