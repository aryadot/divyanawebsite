# Why Can’t We Print More Money?

Let’s take the case of **Germany, 1923**. The country was already suffering from high inflation due to the effects of the war and rising government debt. To pay striking workers, the government simply printed more money. This flood of money led to **hyperinflation**: the more money was printed, the more prices rose. People were seen carrying bags of cash just to buy a loaf of bread.

To understand why printing more money doesn’t solve economic problems, we need the basic idea of **supply and demand**.

## A quick analogy

Let’s say I have only one *Clinique Black Honey* lipstick, and every single one of you wants it. I’m obviously going to give it to the highest bidder—it’s certainly not going for ₹500.

But now imagine I have **a million** of those same lipsticks. I can’t charge top dollar anymore because everyone can easily find one. When something is **limited in supply**, its value rises. The more common something becomes, the **less it’s worth**. That inverse relationship is the key to understanding **inflation**.

## What printing money does

When governments print more money, they **increase the money supply**. If the supply of money grows **without** an increase in goods and services, the **value of money drops**. That’s inflation.

For example, suppose one rupee buys you a candy bar today. If we keep printing money to “fix” problems, the money supply grows, its value falls—and now that same rupee may buy you **half** a candy bar. Over time, your money simply **buys less**.

> **Bottom line:** Printing money looks like an easy fix, but it’s a trap. It **devalues the currency**, **raises prices**, and ultimately makes **everyone poorer**.

### TL;DR
- Printing money ↑ → purchasing power ↓  
- If goods/services don’t increase with money supply, prices rise  
- History’s hyperinflation episodes show how fast this can spiral
